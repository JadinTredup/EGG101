# Arduino Robot Car

## Build the Kit
Follow the instructions below for building the car.

### Step 1: Make sure you have the necessary parts

### Step 2: Remove Paper from Acrylic Base and Differentiate between the Top and Bottom of the Platform
The following picture shows the way to distinguish which side is the top and which side is the bottom of the base. Credit for the image goes to the source: [Columbia Robot Car Instructions](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/presentations/robot-car-instructions.pdf)

### Step 3: Attach the Motors to the Bottom of the Base
The kit comes with 4 smaller acrylic pieces used to mount the wheels to the bottom of the base. To attach the motors follow the steps below, with the pictures as a guide:
1. Remove paper from the 4 acrylic tabs
2. Insert two acrylic tabs into the slots from the top side so that they extend to the bottom.
3. Set the two motors next to each slot so that the axles are towards the front of the base and the wires are on the inside.
4. Place the remaining two acrylic tabs on the outside of the motors, in the designated slots. Make sure tabs and motors are flush with the base.
5. Thread the 4 30mm M3 screws sot hat the motors are held between the acrylic tabs and the screw heads are on the outside.
6. Using 4 M3 nuts, tighten the screws so that the motors are held tightly in place.

### Step 4: Attach the standoffs for the Caster
Before we attach the caster to the back of the car, we need to attach four standoffs so that the caster reaches the same level as the two wheels. To do this, insert four 5mm M3 screws to the front of the base from the top. On the bottom side, screw four of the 10mm M3 standoffs to the base.
